            <span>Grand Fathers are unique members of our families, not everyone is lucky enough to have met their grandfather, much less share so many fun and loving
             memories with them.</span>
            <span>I was so blessed as a child, having grandparents to dote on me. Spoiled was an understatement. Not with things but rather
            with experience, and wealth of knowledge that only they could share with me.</span>
            <span>We lived all together in a big country house in the suburbs of a
             province in Italy. </span>
             <span>My Grand Father was running our farm, he grew up really poor and built that from scratch along with acres of vineyards.
             I became president and producer of a Parmigiano Reggiano distributor and producer in collaboration with Cantine Riunite Lambrusco.
            </span>
            <span>I would often sit by the porch with him and talk for hours.
            His lifestory was inspiring and everyday he would come out with a precious new life advise that I would always keep in consideration.
            He was one of the most brilliant people I've ever met,his charisma was magnetic and he was also a very funny guy!</span><span>This little page is just to say "Thank you" to a very dear person Who taught me life and I miss dearly.</span>
            <span><br/>Love you GrandPa!
